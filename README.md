# NeuralNine RNN
This algorithm predicts stock prices in Python using recurrent neural networks and machine learning. Practice run from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuZY9q-aKLw">NeuralNine</a>. <b>[Published on February 2nd, 2021]</b>

### VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

It is highly recommended to run this program in a ``conda`` environment. Assuming that has already been set up, you can create a ``conda`` environment:
<pre>
<code>$ conda create -n neural_nine python=3.10</code>
</pre>

Now you have set up an isolated environment called ``neural_nine``, a sandbox-like structure to install everything mentioned in the ``requirements.txt`` file. Then you should activate the ``conda`` environment by using the command
<pre>
<code>$ conda activate neural_nine</code>
</pre>

To deactivate the ``conda`` environment:
<pre>
<code>(neural_nine) $ conda deactivate</code>
</pre>

### REQUIREMENTS

You can install the required ``pip`` packages by running
<pre>
<code>(neural_nine) $ conda install --yes --file requirements.txt</code>
</pre>
