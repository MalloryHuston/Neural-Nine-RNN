# NeuralNine RNN
This algorithm predicts stock prices in Python using recurrent neural network and machine learning. Practice run from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuZY9q-aKLw">NeuralNine</a>.

### VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

It is recommended to run this program in a ``conda`` environment. Assuming that has already been set up, you can create a ``conda`` environment:
<pre>
<code>$ conda create -n env_neural python=3.8.8 </code>
</pre>

Now you have set up an isolated environment called ``env_neural``, a sandbox-like structure to install everything mentioned in the ``requirements.txt`` file. Then you should activate the ``conda`` environment by using the command
<pre>
<code>$ conda activate env_neural </code>
</pre>

### REQUIREMENTS

You can install the required ``pip`` packages by running
<pre>
<code>$ conda install --yes --file requirements.txt</code>
</pre>
